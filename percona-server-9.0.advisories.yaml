          note: 'CVE-2021-27928 impacts Distribution for MySQL only up to and including v8.0.28-19 and never existed in the major version 9 releases. This can be seen in the lack of cpe matching for version 9 in the NVD: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27928#range-15316870. As well as the fact that it was remediated in March of 2021 which is before the release of the v9 version stream.'
